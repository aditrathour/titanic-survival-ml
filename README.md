# Titanic Survival Predictor 🚢
A Machine Learning project developed as a 1st-year BCA student to explore Data Science and AI.

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project analyzes the historical Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival based on class, age, and gender. I moved from basic data analysis to a refined Machine Learning model that avoids "Overfitting."

## 📊 Key Insights
- **Accuracy:** Reached **80.81%** by optimizing Decision Tree depth.
- **Data Cleaning:** Handled 177 missing Age records using mean imputation.
- **Visualization:** Created Heatmaps and Countplots to identify survival trends (e.g., the high mortality rate in 3rd class).
- **Probability Logic:** Implemented `predict_proba` to show real survival percentages (like the 38.38% result for 1st-class males).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.14
- **Libraries:** Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn
- **Machine Learning:** Decision Tree Classifier
